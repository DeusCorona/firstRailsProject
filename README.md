## Info on dev environment, server deployment and few important notes I've encountered while making my 1st rails app

* Ruby on Rails v7

* Start localhost deployment with bin/rails serve or rails s -p XXXX, where XXXX is a PORT number (5001 for me in a team)

* Modify routes.rb with desired root, then generate adequate controller, view, helper and tests with bin/rails generate controller main index --skip-routes

* Custom javascript files are linked through a following process described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70548841/how-to-add-custom-js-file-to-new-rails-7-project):
    * Create custom folder under app/javascript and place your custom .js files in it
    * Go to config/importmap.rb and add the following: pin_all_from "app/javascript/custom", under: "custom"
    * Go to app/javascript/application.js file and add the following: import "./custom/kindergarten"
    * Run rails assets:precompile
    * Start server

* Rails forms:
    * https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html
    * https://human-se.github.io/rails-demos-n-deets-2021/demos/new-create-forms/
    * https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html

* Rails forms creation with :
    1. Create Forms folder inside app folder
    2. Inside Forms folder, create a Class that models your form (eg. if you have name and email inputs, add attr_accessors to it, as well as validators)
    3. Change routes.rb inside app/config folder with adequate POST route to view where your form will be located
    4. Create/Change controller that responds to view where your form will be located with @selector eg:
        class MainController < ApplicationController
            def index
                @select_form = SelectForm.new
            end
        end
    5. Utilise <%= form_with(model: @select_form, url:"/") do |f| %> <% end %> syntax when creating form

* Forming links inside view files to other view files eg: <p><%= link_to "About", '/about' %></p>

* Notes about form data submission and adapting controller to obtain POST data:
    * Routes can be formed in such a way that single View component may have multiple routes attached to various methods defined in coresponding Controller eg. get request to: main#index and post request to: main#somePostMethod
    * Extremely useful: using rails routes command to check routes. Method nomenclature in Controllers should be simple, as complicated names may lead to problematic route generation
    * Form inside View must have proper URL target of a method that is supposed to collect data sent via form
    * Data sent via forms comes via **params** , and is in a form of a hash (dictionary data structure)
    * The general flow of action is: form inside View sends a POST request via routes to adequate method inside coresponding controller where data can be separated, analyzed and used
    
* Useful git workflow commands:
 1. git status - overview of the changes made in relation to current branch
 2. git add . - add all changed files to prepare for commit
 3. git commit -m "Some commit message" - commits the added changes to prepare for push
 4. git push - push changes onto the targeted branch
 5. git branch -all - displays all available branches
 6. git checkout - changes branch you're currently on
 7. git checkout -b "name of the branch you wish to create and position onto"
 8. git push --set-upstream origin "name of the branch you have created in previous step"
 9. git rebase --interactive COMMIT_ID - opens editor where you can select from the list of commits you have made to the branch, change to squash next to commit you wish to squash. Second file will be opened where you can edit the commit message you wish to save all your commits under.
 10. git push --force --set-upstream origin name_of_your_remote_branch - finalize the rebase with this
